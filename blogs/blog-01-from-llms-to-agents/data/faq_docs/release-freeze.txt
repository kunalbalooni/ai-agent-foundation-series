Release Freeze Policy

Purpose
The release freeze is a controlled period designed to reduce risk before a scheduled production release. During this window, changes that could affect stability are restricted so that the team can focus on validation, incident response readiness, and release communications.

When the freeze starts
- The standard release freeze begins **48 hours before** the monthly release window.
- Example: If the release window starts on Friday at 18:00 UTC, the freeze begins on Wednesday at 18:00 UTC.

What is allowed during the freeze
- Emergency fixes for SEV1 and SEV2 incidents with explicit approval from the Incident Commander or Release Manager.
- Documentation updates (README, SOPs) that do not change runtime behavior.
- Configuration changes that are low-risk and approved by the Release Manager.

What is not allowed during the freeze
- New feature deployments.
- Schema changes or data migrations.
- Infrastructure changes that could alter capacity, routing, or networking.

Approval process for exceptions
1. File a release-freeze exception request in the #release-management channel.
2. Include: summary of change, risk assessment, rollback plan, and test evidence.
3. The Release Manager must approve the request before deployment.

Rollback expectations
- Every allowed change must include a rollback procedure.
- Rollback should be executable within 30 minutes.

Communication
- Announce the start of freeze in #engineering and #support.
- Post a reminder 24 hours before the release window.

FAQ
- Q: Can we deploy a small UI fix?
  A: Only if it is tied to an incident and approved as an exception.
- Q: Are feature flags allowed?
  A: Only if the flag is already deployed and the change is a safe toggle.
